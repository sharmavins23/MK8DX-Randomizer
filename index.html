            <h1>MK8DX Randomizer</h1>
            <p>
                I've been spending way too much of my free time playing this
                game, and I've learned there's a ridiculous amount of build
                optimization in the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Problematically, I am now too good at the game to enjoy playing
                casually with friends without winning all of the time. As such,
                randomizing my builds (and potentially getting worse builds!)
                may solve this!
            </p>
            <p>
                As I was unable to find a proper randomizer updated for Wave 6's
                updates, and I wanted to also include character stats, I've
                written a simple implementation that does so. It's also
                optimized for mobile screens, which is handy when I'm playing
                with friends.
