# MK8DX Randomizer

I've been spending way too much of my free time playing this game, and I've
learned there's a ridiculous amount of build optimization in the game.

Problematically, I am now too good at the game to enjoy playing casually with
friends without winning all of the time. As such, randomizing my builds (and
potentially getting worse builds!) may solve this!

As I was unable to find a proper randomizer updated for Wave 6's updates, and I
wanted to also include character stats, I've written a simple implementation
that does so. It's also optimized for mobile screens, which is handy when I'm
playing with friends.

Of course, this is written in Vanilla HTML5/CSS/JS. I'm addicted to not using
frameworks (which, frankly, makes my life a living hell!)
